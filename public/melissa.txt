===========
I remember what Jean told me about not writing messages to you 2 years ago. I'm storing these here under some delusion that I'm going to send this to you eventually. Maybe I will, maybe I won't. Who knows.

I also appreciate that you have been gracious in not messaging me and giving me space. I love you till the end of time and even if I've heard rumors that you're talking to someone new it's fine either way. I'm glad I got to know you, and I know you'll do great.

I decided to heavily downsize my course load and take exactly what's necessary to graduate 
I was thinking a lot about my classes and realized a big reason for why I was stressed last year was also because I was taking hard classes and constantly anxious about my grades while also trying to interview for companies 
I'm gonna try to go to a lot of different student orgs and make friends and also work on hobbies this year to try to see what I really enjoy
I was thinking a lot about it today and realized that I was super anxious for the upcoming semester because I had a bunch of pretty difficult classes lined up
And it's not necessary I have four classes to take left

I feel a lot of resentment towards you in terms of our relationship. I feel like things were unequal, that I was putting in way more than I was getting out of it. I also reflect and understand I made a lot of mistakes in our relationship and could have treated you better too. I wonder when you told me that you weren't a good girlfriend and constantly framed it around me if you were trying to guilt trip me, or if you genuinely felt that way. I wonder how you feel about it now. At the same time, it really doesn't matter. There are no what ifs. It wouldn't have worked out.
